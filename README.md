# Lights-Out
Hi! My name is Ryan. I'm a high school student, and I'm interested in Python.

WHAT IS THIS?
This is a game called Lights Out. It was originally released in 1995 by Tiger Electronics.
I built this program virtually from scratch in around two weeks (probably around 15 hours of coding.)

TO RUN:
Download this folder and place it into the 'Downloads' folder -- C:\Users\(yourname)\Downloads\LightsOut.
Open the "LightsOut_Main.py" in PyCharm or your program of choice.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I was helped tremendously by Jaap's Puzzle Page -- jaapsch.net/puzzles.
	It is a great resource for practically anything relating to puzzles.
	It contained the algorithm to solve Lights Out, so I didn't have to find it out myself through trial and error.
The icons for sound were created by Bhima from The Noun Project.
